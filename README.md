# CreateUserAD

Here is an example of Active Directory account user creation, a command line version and a GUI version.
The 2 interfaces will ask:
	 -List item
	 -First name
	-2nd name (not required)
	-Family name
	-The user manager
	-The job
	-Function
	-The expiry date (only for CDD or CDI)
	-And the type of contract (CDI no date), CDD and EXT have a date.
	-The script then sleeps 40 minutes for syncronization to exchange follow your configuration, in case you can delete it or delete the exchange configuration by your email configuration.

# Display AD
The login will be the last name and the first letter of the first name, and add a letter if the login already exists for another user same like : **tartenpionj**
The display will be displayed as: **Tartenpion, Julien (PHS)** or **Tartenpion, Adrien Julien (PHS)**, Will display **(EXT)** for External contract.

# Edit
Of course you have to modify some commands of the script so that they work from your configuration, **so be very careful, I would not be responsible for false manipulations.**

# Files

So you have 2 version of the script: in graphical interface and graphical version. The graphical version will have the same issues with the command line version.
